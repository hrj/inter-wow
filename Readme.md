### Inter-wow

* Works great for screening or interviewing (esp. entry-level) programmers, visualizers, graphic designers, ...
* Can be also used as a teaching aid.

### How it works
Imagine you are the candidate. You are shown an image and you need to write a program that creates this image.

You are provided code to give you a jump-start. You can modify this code to reach the goal, or implement it from
scratch.

### Quick and simple example

Imagine that some code to paint a square is given. Its output is:

![Square](https://hrj.github.io/static/inter-wow/square.svg)

The mission, should you choose to accept it:

![Image](https://hrj.github.io/static/inter-wow/mission.svg)

In this example you might need to parameterize the given code and correctly use iteration or sequence.

### Fizz Buzz
The popular puzzle in visual format:

### Spiral buildup

### Recursion

(Such missions are best accompained with the rules for recursion)


### About this repository
This repository contains code and build files in many languages. Currently supported are C, Java, Scala, Kotlin,
Javascript. PRs for other languages are welcome.

We use SVGs for output, because SVGs
* are just text files; they don't require many dependencies to generate and view
* are declarative (vis-a-vis a rendering API)
* are human readable
* can be rendered in any modern browser
* can be inspected and edited in browsers' dev tools
* have much in common with HTML; can be styled with CSS and scripted with JS
